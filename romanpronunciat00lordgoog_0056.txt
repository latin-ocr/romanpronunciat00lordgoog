the same form as oceurring in nouns and verbs, as re'grs and
regia· and in final syllables contracted or curtailed‚ as finit'
(forfim'vit).

But since on this point the grammarians do not agree
among themselves, either as to number or class ol excep
tions, or even as to the manner ot making them, we may
treat this matter as ol no great importance (as in English,
we please ourselves in saying pe'rsect or perse‘ct). And here
it may be said that due attention to the quantity will oi
itselt often regulata the accent in doubtful cases; as when
we say doce, if we duly shorten the ο and lengthen the e the
effect will be correct, whether the ear ot the grammarian
detect accent on the final syllable, or not. For as Quin-
tilian well says:

Nam ut color oculorum indicio, sapor palati, odor narium
dinoscitur, ita sonus aurium arbitrio subjectus est.³

But besides the length ol the syllable, and the place and
quality of the accent, another matter claims attention.

In English all that is required is to know the place ol the
aecent, which is simply distinguished by greater stress of
voice. This peculiarity oi our language makes it more diffi-
cult for us than ior other peoples to get the Latin accent,
which is one of pitch.

In Latin the acute accent means that on the syllable thus
accented you raise the pitch3 the grave indicates merely
the lower tone; the circumflex, that the voice is first raised,
then depressed‚ on the same syllable. To quote again the
passage from Priscian :

[keil. v. 111. p. sm] Acutus namque accentus ideo inventus est

quod acuat sive elevet syllabam3 gravis vero eo quod deprimat
aut deponet; circumflexus ideo quod deprimat et acuat.
