WHY WE USE IT. < 37

change was made at all is of great weight, audone instance
of β for u would outweigh a dozen instances of the old form,
Ἰ ou. That the letter should be changed in the Greek, even
when it had not been in the Latin, seems to make it certain
that the ‘Greek ear,’ at least, had detected a real variation
of sound from the original u, and one that approached‚ at
least, their β (Eng. v). ' ι
· Nor, in this connection, should we fail to notice the words
in Latin where u consonant is represented by b, such as
bubile from bovile, dgservi and deferbui from deserveo. ⁵

In concluding the argument for the labial v sound of con·
sonantal u, it may be proper to suggest a fact which should
have no weight against a conclusive argument on the other
side, but which might, perhaps, be allowed to turn the scale
nicely balanced. The w sound is not only unfamiliar but
nearly, ii not quite, impossible, to the lipsof any European
people except the English, and would therefore of necessity
have to be left out oi any universally adopted scheme of
Latin pronunciation. Professor Ellis pertinently says: “As
a matter of practical convenience English speakers should
abstain from w in Latin, because no Continental nation can
adopt a sound they cannot pronounce.”

X has the same sound as in English.

Marius Victorinus says:

[keil.v.V1.p.32.] Dehine duae supremae s et x jure jungentur,
narn vicino inter se sonore attracto sibilant rictu, ita tamen si
prioris ictus pone.dentes excitatus ad medium lenis agitetur;
sequentis autem crasso spiritu hispidum sonet qui per conjunc-
tionem c et s, quarum et locum implet et vim exprimit, ut sensu
aurium ducamur efficitur, Α

Again :

> [Id. rb. p. 5.] X autem per c et s possemus scribere.
