THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATlN.

PART I.

WHY WE ΗΒΕ ΙΤ.

IN general, the greater part oi our knowledge of the
pronunciation oi Latin comes from the Latin grammarians‚
whose authority varies greatly in value3 or through inci-
dental statements and expressions of the classic writers
themselves3 or from monumental inscriptions, of these
three, the first is inferior to the other two in quality, but ¹
they in turn are comparatively meagre in quantity,

In the first place, we know (a most important pieee of
knowledge) that, as a rule, Latin was pronounced as written.
This is evident from the fact, among others, that the same
exceptions retur, and are mentioned over and over again,
in the grammarians‚ and that so much is made oi compara-
tively, and confessedly, insignifieant points. Such, we may
be sure, would not have been the case had exceptions been
numerous. Then we have the authority ot Quintilian—
than whom is no higher. He speaks of the subtleties of
the grammarians:

[Quint. 1. tv. 6.] Interiora velut sacri hujus adeuntibus apparebit
multa rerum subtilitas, quae non modo acuere ingenia puerilia sed
exercere altissimam quoque eruditionem ac scientiam possit.

. And says:

[ra. rb. iv. 7.] An cujuslibet auris est exigere litterarum sonos?
