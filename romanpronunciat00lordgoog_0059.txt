46 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

. PART ΙΙ.

How ΤΟ USE ῙΤ.

Trra directions now to be given may be fittingly introduced
by a few paragraphs from Professor Munro’s pamphlet on
the pronunciation of Latin, already more than once quoted
from. He says—and part of this has been cited before:

“We know exactly how Cicero or Quintilian did or could
spell, we know the syllable on which they placed the accent
of almost every word 3 and in almost every case we already
follow thern in this. I have the conviction that in their best
days philological people took vast pains to make the writing
exactly reproduce the sounding; and that if Quintilian or
Tacitus spelt aword differently from Cicero or Livy, he also
spoke it so far differently. With the same amount oi evi·
dence, direct and indirect, we have for Latin, it would not, I
think, be worth anybody’s while to try to recover the pro
nunciation oi French or English; it might, I think, be
worth his while to try to recover that of German or Italian,
in which sound and spelling accord more nearly, and accent
obeys more determinable laws.”

“I am convinced‚” he says in another place, “that the

mainstay of an efficient reform is the adoption essentially oi
the Italian vowel system: it combines beauty, firmness and
precision in a degree not equalled by any other system oi
which I have any knowledge. The little ragged boys in
the streets oi Rome and Florence enunciate their vowels in
a style of which princes might be proud.’' ’
