ii they translate the sounds into their own tongues; while
with us, nothing is left—sound, accent, quantity, all is gone ;
none of these is reproduced, or even suggested, in English.

We believe a great part ot our difficulty, in this country,
lies in the fact that so few of those who study and teach
Latin really know what the ‘Roman pronunciation' is, or
how to use it. inquiries are constantly being made by
teachers, Why is this so? What authority is there for this?
What reason tor that?

In the hope ol giving help to those who desire to know
the Why and the How this little compendium is made; in
the interest ol time-andlabor-saving uniformity‚ and in the
beliet that what cannot be fully known or perfectly acquired ’
does still not prevent our perceiving, and showing in some
worthy manner and to, some satisfactory degree, how, as
well as what, the honey·tongued orators and divine p'oets
ol Rome spoke or sung.

In the following pages free use hasbeen made of the
highest English authorities, ol Oxford and Cambridge.
Quotations will be found from Prof. H. A. J. Munro’s
pamphlet on “Pronunciation ot Latin,'’ and trom Prof.
A. J. Ellis’ book on “Quantitative Pronunciation ot Latin’';
also from the pamphlet issued by the Cambridge (Eng.)
Philological Society, on the “ Pronunciation of Latin in the
Augustan Period.’'

In the present compendium the chief points ot divergence
from the general American understanding of the ‘Roman'
method are in respect of the diphthong ae and the con·
sonantal u. In these cases the pronunciation herein recom-
mended ior the ae is that favored by Roby, Munro, and
Ellis, and adopted by the Cambridge Philological Society,
tor the v, or u consonant, that advocated by Corssen, A. J.
Ellis, and Robinson Ellis.
