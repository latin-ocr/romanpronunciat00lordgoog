WHl' WE USE IT. 35

will certainly apply·lar better to vos than to was. In roos
we get the “projectis labiis ” to some extent, although not
so marked as in oos,· but we do not get anything like the
same “profuso intentoque flatu vocis ” as in vos.

The same may be said oi the argument drawn lrom the
anecdote related by Cicero in his de Divinatione:

[cic. de Div. XL. sn] Cum M. Crassus exercitum Brundisii im·
poneret, quidam in portu caricas Cauno advectas vendens “Cau-
neas !” clamitabat. Dicamus, si placet, monitum ab eo Crassum
caveret ne iret, non fuisse periturum si omini paruisset. ’

Now when we remember that Caunos, whence these par-
ticular figs came, was a Greek town ; that the fig-seller was
very likely a Greek himself (Brundisium being a Greek port
so to speak), but at any rate probably pronounced the name
as it was doubtless always heard ; and that ιι in such a con-
nection is at present pronounced like our f or v, and we
know ol no time when it was pronounced like our u, it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that the lig-seller was cry·
ing “ Cafneas l ’⁹ -a sound iar more suggestive of Canane-
fas! than “ Cauneas !’' oi Cawe necas!

But beyond the testimony, direct and indirect, of gram-
marians and classic writers, an argument against the w
sound appears in the fact that this sound is not found in
Greek (from which the vau is borrowed)‚ nor in ltalian or
kindred Romance languages.

The initial ιι in Italian represents not Latin ιι consonant,
but some other letter, as h, in nomo (for homo). On the
other hand we find the v sound, as aedona (from vidua), —
notice the two v sounds, — or the ιι sometimes changed to
b, as seriore from servare,· bibita and bevonda, both from bibo.

In French we find the Latin ιι consonant passing into f,
as ovum into aeus,· neam into neus.
