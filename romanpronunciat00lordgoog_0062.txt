How ro uss rr. 49

In the pronunciation ol consonants certain points claim
special attention. And first among these is the sounding ol
the doubled consonants. Whoever has heard Italian spoken
recognizes one of its greatest beauties to be the distinctness,
yet smoothness, with which its ll and rr and cc- in short, all
its doubled consonants-are pronounced. No feature ol
the language is more charming. And one who attempts the
same in Latin and perseveres, with whatever difficulty and
pains, will be amply rewarded in the musicos the language.

A good working rule for pronouncing doubled consonants
is to hold the first until ready to pronounce the second: as
in the words we’ll lie till late, not to be pronounced as we lie
till ezglrt.

Next in importance, and, in N ew England at least, first in ·

difficulty, is the trilling of the r. There can be no approxi-
mation to a satisfactory pronunciation of Latin until this r
is acquired3 but the satisfaction in the result when accom-
plished is well worth all the pains taken.

Another point to be observed is that the dentals t, d, n, 1,
require that the tongue touch the teeth, rather than the
palate. Munro says: “d and t we treat with our usual
slovenliness, and force thern up to the rooi ol our mouth:
we should make thern real dentals, as no doubt the Romans
made thern, and then we shall see how readily ad at, apud
aput, illud illut and the like interchange.'' This requires
care, but amply repays the effort.

It is necessary also to remember that n before a guttural
is pronounced as in the same position in English, e.g., in
ancora as in anchor, in anxius as in anxious; in relinquo as

⁹ in relinquish.

Remember to make n before f ors a mere nasal, having
as little prominence otherwise as possible, and to careiully
lengthen the preceding vowel.
