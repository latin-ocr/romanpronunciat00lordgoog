8 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF Lem.

Munro says:

“ lu Lucilius's time the rustica said Ceailiuspretor ior Cae-
cilius praetem· in two Samothraciam inscriptions older than
uc. roo (the sound oi ai by that tirne verging to an open
θ), we find musta piei and musta: in similar inscriptions
μύσται piei, and mystae: Paeligni is reproduced in Strabo by
Πελιγνόιε Cicero, Virgil, Festus, and Servius all alike give
caestus ior κεστόςε by the first century, perhaps sooner, e
was very frequently put for ae in words like taeter: we often
find teter, erumna, mestus, presta and the like: soon inscrip
tions and MSS. began pertinaciously to offer ae lor ὅ : prae·
tum, praeces, quaerella, argestes and the like, the ae represent-
ing a short and very open e: sometimes it stands ior a long
e, as often in plaenus, the liquid before and after making
perhaps the e more open (σκηνή is always scaena): and it is
lrorn this form plaenus that in Italian, contrary to the usual
law oi long Latine, we have piena with open e. With such
pedigree then, and with the genuine Latin ae always repre-
sented in Italian by open e, can we hesitate to pronounce
the αθ with this open e sound l '⁹

The argument sometimes used, for pronouncing αθ like
αἱ, tliat in the poets we occasionally find αἱ in the genitive
singular oi the fir'st declension, appears to have little weight
in view oi the following explanation:

[nar. vict. ae onhog. et re neu. uas, 1. nt. a] he syllabam quidam
‘ more Graecorum persi scribunt, nec illud quidem custodient, quia
omnes lere, qui de orthographia aliquid scriptum reliquerunt, prae· ι
cipiunt, nomina femina casu nominativo α finita, numero plurali in
αθ exire, ut Aeliae: eadem pera et i scripta numerum singularem
ostendere, ut hujus Aelr'ai: inducti a poetis, qui pictai vestes
scripserunt: et quia Graeci per i potissimum hanc syllabam scri-
bunt propter exilitatem litterae, η autem propter naturalem pro
ductionem jungere vocali alteri non possunt: iota vero, quaeest
