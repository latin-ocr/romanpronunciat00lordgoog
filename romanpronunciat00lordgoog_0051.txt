38 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIA ΤΙΟΝ OF LA ΤΙΝ.

And t

Posteaquam a Graecis ξ, et a nobis x, recepta est, abiit et
illorum et nostra perplexa ratio, et in primis observatio Nigidii,
qui in libris suis x littera non est usus, antiquitatem sequens.

X suffers a long vowel before it, being composed of the c
(the only mute that allows along vowel before it) and thes.

Z probably had a sound akin to ds in English. After
giving the sound of x as οε, Marius Victorinus goes on to
speak of z thus:

[Keil. v. V1. ρ. 5.] Sic et z, simodo latino sermoni necessaria
esset, per d et e litteras faceremus.

A syllable in Latin may consist of from one to six letters,
as a, ab, ars, Mars, stans, stirps.

In dividing into syllables, a consonant between two
vowels belongs to the vowel following it. When there are
two consonants, the first goes with the vowel before, the
ν second with the vowel after, unless the consonants form
such a combination as may stand at the beginning of a
word (Latin or Greek), that is, as may be uttered with a single
impulse, as one letter; in which case they go, as one, with
the vowel following. An apparent exception is made in the
case of compound words. These are divided into their
component parts when these parts remain intact.

On these points Priscian says: .

Si antecedens syllaba terminat in consonantem necesse est et
sequentem a consonante incipere, ut artus, ille, arduus,· nisi sn
compositum: ut abeo, adeo, pereo.

Nam in simplicibus dictionibus necesse est a etc ejusdem esse
syllabae, utpascua, luscus. .
