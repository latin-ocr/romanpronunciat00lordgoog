WHY WE USE IT.

And again :

[ld. ib. p. μ] Κ et q supervacue numero litterarum inseri doc-
torum plerique contendunt, scilicet quod c littera harum officium
possit implere.

The grammarians tell us that k and q are always found
at the beginning of a syllable:

[Prisc. Keil. v. 111. p.111.] Q et lr semper initio syllabarum po
nuntur.

They say also that the use of q was more free among the
earlier Romans, who placed it as initial wherever u fol-
lowed, -as they placed k wherever a followed, -but that
in the later, established, usage, its presence was conditioned
upon a vowel after the uin the same syllable:

[Donat. Keil. v. 1V.p. 442.] Namque illi q praeponebant quotiens
ιι sequebatur, ut quum nos vero non possumus q praeponere
nisi utu sequatur et post ipsam alia vocalis, ut quoniam.

Diomedes says:

[Keil. v. 1. p. ns] Q consonans muta, ex c etu litteris composita,
supervacua, qua utimur quando ιι et altera vocalis in una syllaba
junguntur, ut Quirinus.

R is trilled, as in ltalian or French:

[Manet. neu. v. vr. p. μ] Sequetur r, quae, vibratione vocis
in palato linguae fastigio, fragorem tremulis ictibus reddit

(This proper trilling of the r is most important.)

S seems to have had, almost, if not quite, invariably the
sharp sound of the English s in sing, hisr.

In Greek words written also with z, as Smyrna (also
written Zmyrna), it probably had the z sound, and possibly
in a few Latin words, as rosa, meter, but this is not certain.
