36 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

It seems not improbable that in Cicero’s time and later
the consonant ιι represented some vvariation oi sound‚ that
its value varied in the direction of b or f, and possibly, in
some Greek words especially, it was more vocalized, as in
vae! (Greek ουάι).- Yet here it is worthy oi note that the
corresponding words in Italian are not written with u but
with gu, as guai s

In considering the sound oi Latin ιι consonant we must
always keep in mind that the question is one oi time, -not,
was ιι ever pronounced as English w; but, was it so pro
nounced in the time of Cicero and Virgil. Professor Ellis
well says: “Any one who wishes to arrive at a conclusion
respecting the ,Latin consonantal ιι must learn to pronounce
and distinguish readily the four series of sounds: tia tie ui
ilo, wa we wi wo wu, v'a v’e v’i v’o v’u, va ve vi vo
Vll-'⁹ ’

Now the question is: At what point along this line do
we find the u consonant oi the golden age? Roby, though
not agreeing with Ellis in rejecting the English w sound‚ as
the representative of that period, declares himself “quite
content to think that a labial v was provincially contem·
porary-and in the end generally superseded it.’'

But ‘provincialisms’ do not seem sufficient to account
for the use of β for ιι consonant in inscriptions and in
writers oi the first century. For instance, Nerua and
Severus in contemporary inscriptions are written both with
ου and with β : Nr'pouu, Ne'pssa3 Σεουῆρος, Σεβῆρος. And in
Plutarch we find numerous instances of β taking the place
of ου.

It is true that the instances in which we find β taking the
place otoo in the first century, and earlier, are decidedly in
the minority, but when we recollect that ου was the original
and natural representative of the Latin u, the fact that a
