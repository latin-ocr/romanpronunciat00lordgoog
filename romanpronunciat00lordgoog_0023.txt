10 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

B before s or t is sharpeued to p: thus urbs is pro·
nounced nrp'm obtinuit, optinuit. Some words, indeed, are
written either way, as obses, or opses,· obsonium, or cpbsoniunr,
obtingo‚ or optingo,· and Quintilian says it is a question
whether the change should be indicated in writing or not:

[Quint. 1. vii. 7.] Quaeri solet, in scribendo praepositiones, sonum
quem junctae efficiunt an quem separatae, observare conveniat: ut
cum dico obtinuit, secundam enim b litteram ratio poscit, aures
magis audiunt p.

This change, however, is both so slight and so natural
that attention need scarcely be called to it. Indeed ii quan-
tity is properly observed, one can hardly go wrong. If, for
instance, you attempt, in saying obtinuit, to give its normal
sound tob, you can scarcely avoid making a false quantity
(the first syllable too long), while ii you observe the quan-

tity (first syllable short) your b will change itself to p.
C appears to have but one sound, the hard, as in senatu:

[Maevict. Keil. v. VI. p. μ] C etiam et. . . G sono proximae,
oris molimine nisuque dissentiunt. Nam c reducta introrsum
lingua hinc atque hinc molares urgens haerentem intra os sonum
vocis excludit: g vim prioris pari linguae habitu palato suggerens
lenius reddit.

Not only do we find no hint in the grammarians oi any
sound akin to the soit e in English, as in scutra, but they
all speak oi c and k andq as identical, or substantially su,
in sound; and Quintilian expressly states that the sound oi
c is always the same. Speaking of k as superfluous, he

says ι

[uuna. 1. vii. ια] Nam k quidem in nullis verbis utendum puto,
nisi quae significat, etiam ut sola ponatur. Hoc eonon omisi,
quod quidam eam. quotiens aa sequatur necessariam credunt, cum
sit c littera, quae adbmuesvohaies vim suam perierat.
