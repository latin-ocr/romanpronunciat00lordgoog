WHY WE USE JT. 29

By which we understand that the t was wrongly uttered
with a kind oi effort, such as prevented its gliding on to
the i.

Th nearly as in then, not as in trin.

U (consonant) or V.

That the letter ιι performed the office of both vowel and
consonant all the grammarians agree, and state the fact in
nearly the same terms. Priscian says that they (i and u)
seem quite other letters when used as consonants, and that
it makes a great difference in which of these ways they are
used :

[Keil. v. 11. p. ra] Videntur tamen 1 ctu cum in consonantes
transeunt quantum ad potestatem, quod maximum est in elementis,
aliae litterae esse praeter supra dictis, multum enim interest
utrum vocales sint an consonantes.

The grammarians also state that this consonant ιι was
represented by the Greek digamma, which the Romans
called vau also,

Marius Victorinus says:

[1. in. 44.] N am littera ιι vocalis est, sicut a, e, i, o, sed eadem
vicem obtinet consonantis: cujus potestatis notam Graeci habent
f, nostri aiau vocant, et alii digamma; caper se scripta non iacit
syllabam, anteposita autem vocali iacit, ut ιεάιιιιξιι, paxnullos et
ιεελένη. Nos vero, qui non habemus hujus vocis nomen aut
notam, in ejus locum quotiens una vocalis pluresve junctae unam
syllabam faciunt, substituimus ιι litteram.

Now it is contended by some that this digamma, or rrau,
was merely taken as a symbol, somewhat arbitrarily perhaps,
and that it did not indicate a particular sound‚ but might
stand ior anything which the Romans chose to represent by
it; and that therefore it gives us no certain indication oi
what the Latin ιι consonant was.
