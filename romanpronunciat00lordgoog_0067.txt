54 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

a short syllable at the end of the verse is as if you ‘stood'
(came to a stand), but a long one as if you ‘sat down'?

Itis, infact, in the pronouncing of final syllables every-
where that the most serious and persistent faults are found,
bris for bris being one of the worst and most common cases.
How much of the teacher’s time might be spared, for better
things, if he did not have to correct bris into bztss

The disposition to neglect the double and doubled con-
sonants is another serious fault, 'as well as the slovenly pro
nunciation of two consonants, where the reader fails to give
the time necessary to speak each distinctly, making false
quantity and mispronunciation at the same time.

In general, if two symbols are written we are to infer that
two sounds wer'e intended. The only exception to this is
in the case of a few words where the spelling varies, as
casso or caso. In such cases we may suppose that the
doubled consonant was only designed to indicate length.

Another, apparent, exception is in the case of a mute fol·
lowed by a liquid; but the mute and liquid are regularly
sounded as one, and therefore do not affect the length of
the preceding vowel. Sometimes, however, for the sake of
time, the verse requires them to be pronounced separately.
In this case each is to be given distinctly3 the mute and
liquid must not coalesce. For it must not be forgotten that,
as a rule, the vowel before a mute followed by a liquid is short,
in which case it must on no account be lengthened. Thus,
ordinarily, we say pri-tris, but the verse may require pat-ris.

Although the vowel before two consonants is generally
short, we find, in some instanceS, along vowel in this posi·
tion. For example, it would appear that the vowel of the
supine and cognate parts of the verb is long if the vowel of
the present indicative, though short, is followed by a medial ἰ
(b, g, d, Z), as dctus, lictus, from rigo, llgo.
