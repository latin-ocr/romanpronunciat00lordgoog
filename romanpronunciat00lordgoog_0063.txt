50 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

Studiously observe the length of the vowel before the ter·
minations gnus, gna, gnum.

Remember that the final syllable in m, when not elided,
is to be pronounced as lightly and rapidly as possible, the
more lightly and indistinetly the better.

Remember that s must not be pronounced as z, except
where it represents z in Greek wordS, as Smyrna (Zmyrna),
Smaragdus (Zmaragdus), otherwise always pronounce as in
sis.

Remember in pronouncing v to direct the lower lip to
ward the upper lip, avoiding the upper teeth.

In general, in pronouncing the consonants conform to the
following scheme :

b as in blab.

bbefore s or t, sharpened to p, as urbs=urps; obtinuit:
optinuit.

c as sceptic (never as in sceptre).

ch asin chemist (never as in cheer or chivalry).

das in did, but made more dental than in English.

d final, before a word beginning with a consonant, in particles
especially, often sharpened to t as in tid-bit (tit-bit).

f as in fief, but with more breath than in English.

g as in gig (never as in gin).

gn in terminations gnus, gna, gnum, makes preceding vowel long.

h as in hah l

i (consonant) as in onion.

k as in kink.

1 initial and final, as in lull.

lmedial, as in lullaby, always more dental than in English.

m initial and medial, asin membrane.

m before q, nasalized.

m final, when not elided, touched lightly and obscurely, some
what as in tandem (tandm) 3 or as in the Englishman’s
pronunciation of Blenheim (Blenhm), Birmingham (Bir-
minghm).
