52 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.

of a sentence he thinks was not heard at all. Where a
vowel followed he thinks that the m was not heard, the
vowel before being slurred on to the initial vowel of the
following word.

The Cambridge (Eng.) Philological society, however,
takes -the view that “final vowels (or diphthongs) when
followed by vowels (or diphthongs) were not cut off, but
lightly run on to the following word, as in Italian. But
if the vowel was the same the effect was that of a single
sound.”

Professor Munro says:

“ In respect of elision I would only say that, by compar-
ing Plautus with Ovid, we may see how much the elaborate
cultivation of the language had tended to a more distinct
sounding of final syllables3 and that but for Virgil’s power·
ful influence the elision of long vowels would have almost
ceased. Clearly we must not altogether pass over the elided
vowel or syllable in m, except perhaps in the case of ἔ in
common words, que, neque, and the like.’'

This view, held by the Cambridge Philological Society
and by Professor Munro, is the one generally accepted3
the practice recommended by them is theone generally in
use, and that which seems safe and suitable to follow.
That is: Do not altogether pass over the elided vowel or
syllable in m, except in cases of very close connection, in
compound words or phrases, or when the final and initial
vowel are the same, or in the case of ἕ final in common
words, as que, neque, and the like; but let the final vowel
run lightly on to the following vowel as in Italian, and touch
lightly and obscurely the final syllable in m. The 0 ore of
prom, proinde, prout, dein, deinde, neuter, neutiquam, when not

forming a distinct syllable, are to be treated as cases of
elision between two words.
