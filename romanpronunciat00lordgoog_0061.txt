48 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATJON OF LATIN.

justly terms “hateful barbarisms like coelum, coena, moestus.'’
Much time is wasted by students and bad habits are acquired
in not finding, at the outset, the right spelling of each word
and holding to it. This each student must do for himself,
consulting a good dictionary‚ as editors and editions are not
always to be depended on. Here it is the diphthongs that
present the chief difficulty and call for the greatest care.

In pronouneing diphthongs sound both vowels, but glide
so rapidly from the first to the second as to offer to the ear
buta single sound. In the publication of the Cambridge
(Eng.) Philological Society on “Pronunciation of Latin in
the Augustan Peri0d‚'’ the following directions are given:

“The pronunciation of these diphthongs‚ of which the

. last'three 'are extremely rare, is best learnt by first sounding

each vowel separately and then running them together, ae
as ah-eh‚ au as ah-oo, oe as 0·eh, ei as eh·ee, eu as eh-oo,

and ui as ooee.''
Thus :

ae (aheh) as in German nahem· or as ea in pear; or ay in
aye (ever); (not like ἃ in fate nor like ai in aisle).

ai (ah-ee) asin aye (yes).

au (ah-60) as in German Hans, with more of the u sound than
ou in house.

ei (eh-ee) nearly as in veil. (ln dein, deinde, the ei is not a
diphthong, but the e, when not forming a distinct syllable,
is elided.)

eu (eh-do) asin Italian Europa. (ln neuter and neutiquam
elide the e.) .

oe (oeli) nearly like German δ in Goetlze.

oi is not found in the classical period. (ln proin, proinde, the
ο is either elided or forms a distinet syllable. ou in prout
is not a diphthong 3 the u is either elided or forms a dis·
tinet syllable.)

ul (ooe‘e) asin cuirass.
