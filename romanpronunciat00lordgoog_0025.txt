12 THE ROMAN PRONUNCIA TION OF LATIN.

the writer saw no difference between c and k, so to the
writer oi the former k was the same as c before e.’'

Again he says:

“And finally, what is to me most convincing oi all, I do
not well understand how in a people oi grammarians, when
ior seven hundred years, from Ennius to Priscian, the most
distinguished writers were also the most minute philologerS,
not one, sofar as we know, should have hinted at any dif-
ference, ii such existed.''

As to the peculiar effect of c tinal in certain particles
to “lengthen’' the vowel before it, this e is doubtless the
remnant oi the intensive enclitic ce, and the socalled
‘length' is not in the vowel, but in the more forcible
utterance of the e. It is true that Priscian says:

[Reii. v. 11. p. ³4] Notandum, quod ante hanc solam mutam
finalem inveniuntur longae vocales ut lro‘c, hdr, sic, hic adverbium.

And Probus speaks oi cas often prolonging the vowel
betore it. But Victorinus, more philosophically', attributes
the length to the “ double '' sound of the consonant:

[Marsvict. 1. v. 4⁶.] Consideranda ergo est in his duntaxat pro
nominibus natura c litterae, quae crassum quodammodo et quasi
geminum sonum reddat, hic et hoc.

And he adds that you do not get that more emphatic
sound in, ior instance, the conjunction nec.

Si autem nec conjunctionem aspiciamus, licet eadem littera
finitam, diversum tamen sonabit.

And again:

Ut dixi, in pronominibus c littera sonum efficit crassiorem.

Pompeius, commenting upon certain vices of speech, says
that some persons bring out the final e in certain words tot
hervily, pronouncing sic ludit as sic cludit ,· while others, on
