WHY WE USE JT.

And Priscian declares:

[Keil. v. 11. p. ῃ] Quamvis in varia figura et vario nomine sint
ket q et c, tamen quia unam vim habeut tam in metro quam in
s0n0, pro una littera accipi debent.

Without the best of evidence we should hardly believe
that words written indifferently with ae or e after c would
be so differently pronounced by those using the diphthong
and those using the simple vowel, that, to take the instance

already given, in the time of Lucilius, the rustic said Scsilius
for Kaekile'ns. Nor does it seem probable that in different
cases the same word would vary so greatly, or that in the
numerous compounds where after e the aweakens to i the
sound of the c was also changed from kto S, as “hepta’'
“ inszpio ”,· “ kedo,’' “ insido.'’

Quintilian, noting the changes of fashion in the sounding
of the h, enumerates, among other instances of excessive
use of the aspirate, the words choronee (for coronae), chen·
lurcones (for centuriones), praechones (for praecones), as if the
three words were alike in their initial sound.

Alluding to inscriptions (first volume), where we have
pulcher and pulcer, Gracchis and Graecas, Mr. Munro says:
“l do not well see how the aspirate could have been attached
to the c,ifchad notaksound, or how in this casecbefore
cori could have differed from c before a, 0, u.'’

Professor Munro also cites an inscription (844 of the
“Corpus Inscr.,’' vol. I.) bearing on the case in another
way. In this inscription we have the word dekembres.
“This'' says Mr. Munro, “is one of nearly two hundred
short, plebeian, often half-barbarous, very old inscriptions
on a collection of ollae. The k before e, or any letter ex-
cept a, is solecistic, justas in no. 831 is the c, instead of k,
for calendas. From this Ι would infer that, as ‘ux sue &asser
